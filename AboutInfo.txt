            A long serpentine creature slithers across a limited field,
            obeying the player's orders (moving right, left, down, and up).
            And there's no way to stop it from moving. Just don't touch the
            boundaries or you'll die! And don't bite yourself or... well, 
            you get the idea.Along the way,the creature encounters food that 
            makes it even longer.As it grows,it gets more and more cramped... 

            This game originated in the 1970s.That's when it first appeared 
            on arcade machines.In the 21st century,it was popularized by Nokia, 
            which pre-installed Snake on almost all their mobile phones.
